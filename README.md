# Vehicle Physics in UE5
Unreal Engine 5 and C++ <br><br>
Since I was a kid, I've always loved racing games. This is my attempt at recreating complete car mechanics from scratch using C++ in Unreal Engine 5. This involves building everything from the ground up, including realistic vehicle movement, handling, and physics, plus other fun features from famous games like rocket launchers etc.
